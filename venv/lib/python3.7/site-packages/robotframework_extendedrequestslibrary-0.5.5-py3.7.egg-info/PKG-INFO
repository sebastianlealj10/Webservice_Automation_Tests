        Introduction
        ------------
        
        ExtendedRequestsLibrary is an extended HTTP client library for `Robot Framework`_
        with OAuth2_ support that leverages the requests_ project,
        `requests-oauthlib`_ project, and RequestsLibrary_ project.
        
        More information about this library can be found in the `Keyword Documentation`_.
        
        Example
        '''''''
        
        .. code:: robotframework
        
            *** Settings ***
            Library    ExtendedRequestsLibrary
        
            *** Test Cases ***
            Post Request With Client Credentials
                Create Client OAuth2 Session    client    https://token    key    secret    base_url=https://service
                ${var} =    Post Request    client    /endpoint    json=${“key": "value"}
                Log    ${var}
                Delete All Sessions
        
            Post Request With Password
                Create Password OAuth2 Session    member    https://token    key    secret    usn    pwd    base_url=https://service
                ${var} =    Post Request    member    /endpoint    json=${“key": "value"}
                Log    ${var}
                &{files} =    Create Dictionary    file1=/path/to/a_file.ext    file2=/path/to/another_file.ext
                ${var} =    Post Request    member    /endpoint    files=&{files}
                Log    ${var}
                Delete All Sessions
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Using ``pip``
        '''''''''''''
        
        The recommended installation method is using pip_:
        
        .. code:: console
        
            pip install robotframework-extendedrequestslibrary
        
        The main benefit of using ``pip`` is that it automatically installs all
        dependencies needed by the library. Other nice features are easy upgrading
        and support for un-installation:
        
        .. code:: console
        
            pip install --upgrade robotframework-extendedrequestslibrary
            pip uninstall robotframework-extendedrequestslibrary
        
        Notice that using ``--upgrade`` above updates both the library and all
        its dependencies to the latest version. If you want, you can also install
        a specific version or upgrade only the requests project used by the library:
        
        .. code:: console
        
            pip install robotframework-extendedrequestslibrary==x.x.x
            pip install --upgrade requests
            pip install requests==x.x.x
        
        Proxy configuration
        '''''''''''''''''''
        
        If you are behind a proxy, you can use ``--proxy`` command line option
        or set ``http_proxy`` and/or ``https_proxy`` environment variables to
        configure ``pip`` to use it. If you are behind an authenticating NTLM proxy,
        you may want to consider installing CNTML_ to handle communicating with it.
        
        For more information about ``--proxy`` option and using pip with proxies
        in general see:
        
        - http://pip-installer.org/en/latest/usage.html
        - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9698557/how-to-use-pip-on-windows-behind-an-authenticating-proxy
        - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14149422/using-pip-behind-a-proxy
        
        Manual installation
        '''''''''''''''''''
        
        If you do not have network connection or cannot make proxy to work, you need
        to resort to manual installation. This requires installing both the library
        and its dependencies yourself.
        
        - Make sure you have `Robot Framework installed`_.
        
        - Download source distributions (``*.tar.gz``) for the library and its dependencies:
        
          - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework-extendedrequestslibrary
          - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework-requestslibrary
          - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-oauthlib
          - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests
        
        - Download PGP signatures (``*.tar.gz.asc``) for signed packages.
        
        - Find each public key used to sign the package:
        
        .. code:: console
        
            gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --search-keys D1406DE7
        
        - Select the number from the list to import the public key
        
        - Verify the package against its PGP signature:
        
        .. code:: console
        
            gpg --verify robotframework-extendedrequestslibrary-x.x.x.tar.gz.asc robotframework-extendedrequestslibrary-x.x.x.tar.gz
        
        - Extract each source distribution to a temporary location.
        
        - Go to each created directory from the command line and install each project using:
        
        .. code:: console
        
               python setup.py install
        
        If you are on Windows, and there are Windows installers available for
        certain projects, you can use them instead of source distributions.
        Just download 32bit or 64bit installer depending on your system,
        double-click it, and follow the instructions.
